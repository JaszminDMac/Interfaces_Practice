## Assignment Description

Programming Practice
5.1   Design a Java interface called Priority that has two methods: setPriority and getPriority.  The interface should let us number a set of objects in the order of their importance.  Design and implement a class called Task that implements the Priority interface.  Create a driver class to use some Task objects. 

5.2 Make a copy of the previous project.  Change the Task class so that it also implements the Comparable interface from the Java standard class library.  Implement the interface so that the tasks are listed in the order of their importance.  Create a driver class whose main method shows these new features of Task objects.

5.2 e.c.:  Make a copy of the project from 5.2.  Again change the Task class so that now it also implements the Complexity interface given on slide 9 from the lesson.  Change the driver class to show the new features.
